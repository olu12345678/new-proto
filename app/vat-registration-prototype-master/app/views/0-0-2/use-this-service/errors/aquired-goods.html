                    <p>If you are not VAT registered and receive goods from countries in the EU, your supplier will
                        charge VAT at the local rate in the EU country from which the goods are supplied. </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to register for VAT in the UK and record the time of acquisition on your VAT
                        returns.
